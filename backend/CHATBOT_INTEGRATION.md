# ðŸ¤– Chatbot Integration with Gemini AI

## Overview
The chatbot system integrates Gemini AI to provide intelligent responses about energy management, carbon footprint, and sustainability tips.

## Backend Components

### 1. Chatbot Service (`src/services/chatbot.service.js`)
- **Purpose**: Handles Gemini AI integration
- **Features**:
  - Generates contextual responses using Gemini 1.5 Flash
  - Provides personalized advice based on user context
  - Handles fallback responses if AI fails

### 2. Chatbot Controller (`src/controllers/chatbot.controller.js`)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/chatbot/message` - Send message to chatbot
  - `GET /api/chatbot/suggestions` - Get quick reply suggestions
  - `GET /api/chatbot/info` - Get chatbot capabilities

### 3. Chatbot Routes (`src/routes/chatbotRoutes.js`)
- **Route Configuration**: Defines all chatbot API endpoints
- **Middleware**: Handles request/response processing

## Frontend Components

### 1. Chatbot Component (`frontend/src/components/Chatbot.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time messaging interface
  - Integration with backend API
  - Fallback responses for offline mode
  - Quick question suggestions
  - Typing indicators

### 2. Integration
- **API Calls**: Uses fetch to communicate with backend
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock responses
- **User Experience**: Smooth chat interface with animations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install @google/generative-ai

# Set up environment variables
# Add to .env file:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Start backend server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
# The chatbot component is already integrated
# No additional setup required
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Test backend API
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/chatbot/info"

# Test message sending
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chatbot/message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How can I save energy?", "userId": "68c4f56fd13e6b30224f402c"}'
```

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors:
- API key issues
- Gemini service unavailable
- Network connectivity problems
- Invalid request format

### Frontend Errors:
- Backend server unavailable
- Network connection issues
- API response errors
- User input validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Context Integration**: Use actual user data for personalized responses
2. **Conversation History**: Store and retrieve chat history
3. **Voice Input**: Add speech-to-text capabilities
4. **Rich Media**: Support for images and documents
5. **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages
6. **Analytics**: Track user interactions and popular questions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Cannot find module" errors**: Run `npm install` in backend directory
2. **API key errors**: Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in .env file
3. **CORS errors**: Check CORS configuration in app.js
4. **Frontend not connecting**: Verify backend server is running on port 8000

### Debug Steps:
1. Check backend server logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test API endpoints with curl
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify network connectivity

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- User input is sanitized before sending to AI
- Rate limiting should be implemented for production
- User data is not stored permanently in chat history
